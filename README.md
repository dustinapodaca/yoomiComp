# Yoomi Component Project

## Implement the Component

Following the Figma document and comments, implement the component with the supplemental metadata provided. If some implementation details are not specified, feel free to implement it as you see fit.

### a. Create a sandbox application
Use the Create React App with TypeScript guide to create a sandbox application for your implementation.

### b. Metadata file
We provide a metadata file with three example exercises. Create a type that matches the general form of the exercise and use this in your implementation.

### c. Code Review Criteria
When we review your code, we will be looking for the following:

- **Concise implementation**: The implementation should be straightforward and concise.

- **Code style**: Adherence to code style guidelines, including appropriate use of JS DOC and in-line comments.

- **Efficient implementation**: Correct and efficient use of React hooks. We expect to see use of hooks like `useMemo` or `useCallback`, demonstrating you are capable of using them correctly and efficiently.

- **Unit/Integration tests**: Ability to write unit/integration tests. Your code should have one or more Jest test suites that achieve at least 80% coverage. You may organize your testing as you see fit, as long as the aforementioned requirements are met.
